# Quick-Poll
Allows Users to create a Poll, giving it a unique name and hardcoding the options seperated by commas (instead of typing them out in seperate generated boxes). 

This data is stored in the localStorage Object in JS and is used henceforth to avoid duplicate polls and to store all the poll data so that it is accessible when another user wants to vote in it.

Users could vote in a already created poll by typing in the Name of the poll which is cross verified with the Poll Names in localStorage and eventually Displayed back.

Allows only 1 vote per session.

Still in Development, More Features to be added.
